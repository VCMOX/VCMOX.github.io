          <p> According to the Museum of Vision, historians believe optic lens can date all the way back to ancient Roman times to aid spectators in areas, however, the invention of the eyeglass is speculated to originate in Europe. The ergonomics of the first eyeglass was thought to be handheld due to the weight of natural crystal. To address this issue glass was used instead of crystal although it was still not entirely precise in improving vision the development of “flint glass” resolved the issue by bending at various angles through the use of two types of glass layered on top of each other. The development of optic lens’ and the understanding of optic laws is important to the advancement of lens. Furthermore, the lens found in cameras today.
Jumping to the discovery of photography during the mid -1830s,  and the camera obscura, one of the first “pinhole” camera that manipulated light to form an image we see the commencement of the camera lens. Charles L. Chevalier adapted the eyeglass lens to the camera lens for a camera obscura, and this was the first development of camera lens’.</p>
