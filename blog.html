         <h2>Blog 1: Web Design Critique: Cold Press Juice</h2>
         <p>HIERARCHY: The homepage of this website is direct. The navigation bar clearly displays necessary information however, the “gallery” tab does not display any photos it simply has the social media handle. Back on the homepage the center logo doubles as the home button almost like the apple iPhone design. Once navigated to the “products” tab instead of having to scroll through another folder, a sidebar pops up. The sidebar offers the various juice options and moves with the screen which I think is helpful as this is primarily a website to purchase juices.
           IMAGERY: The image used on the home page allows viewers to identify what this website is about even without knowing the name of the company or the product/ service they provide. The whole foods that are included in the image add decorative element and imply the company has a holistic approach.
           The background of the whole website is semi muted in contrast to the bright ingredient and juice bottle images.
           USABILITY: Despite the homepage being minimal and straightforward, the products page and the “about” page are the most content heavy.
           The products page is way more interactive and cleverly becomes lengthy as you continue scrolling to view the ingredients. The ingredients that are listed are done with an interactive approach, you can easily click on the ingredient pictures and get a full pop up description without having to go into another page entirely.
           Nutritional information is also found where the ingredients are displayed.
           COLOR: There are multiple color schemes used throughout the website mostly in the product section.
           The color schemes used compliment the type and composition  of juice. The type color is standard white and that evokes a fresh, modern feel. The website makes the most out of the images of the juice bottles and the ingredients which are bright and vivid while the blocky color swatches simply enhance appearance.</p>

           <h2>Blog 2: Creating Roasters Page</h2>
           <p>Creating the Roasters page was simple enough, mainly because it was only a matter of filling in the changes on the Roasters html file.
            One of the difficulties I had was linking the roaster page with the same css file used to style to the coffee shop html file.
            I made a separate css file for the roasters but I forgot how to change this on github so I ditched that idea. After  trying to link the html file for the roasters file with the same css file,
            I realize my main confusion was understanding how will the coffeeshop html file and the roasters html file use the same style sheet to make the same changes.
            My last difficulty was moving the footer img on the roasters file which I somehow made possible by copy pasting similar nodes from the commands made on the paragraph portion.</p>

          <h2>Blog 3: Design Persona Article </h2>
          <p>In the article "Crafting a Design Persona,” learning about the power of personality - in the context of product design shed some light on how developing a clear goal for my technology webpage could help achieve its purpose effectively.
           In the article it covered the importance of articulating a design persona, how your product should communicate with the users. It also elaborated in how it can be used to solve design problems, the difference between user persona and design persona the difference
           being a design persona helps to understand how a product can build a relationship with users and how personifying your product can help develop product ideas. Through this article I better understood the type of design personas that were useful.
           I wish the author covered in more detail the brand traits given for the sample design product being used. I also found the section on surprising elements to be interesting because I find that when a webpage for example has something unexpected such as an interactive element,
           it makes the webpage that much more more dynamic and interesting. I think my main take away is how creating a design persona  can be an investment to your product because it can possibly the reason your product has a lasting positive impression on users. </p>
