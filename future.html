          <p>Lens designing and engineering have led to the development self-adjusting lenses with sensors that quietly detect objects in high-speed, stabilizing elements that allow for sharper images, and zoom features to enhance the range of sight like the Sigma 4.5mm f/2.8, currently one of the widest lens that can capture 180 landscape in a single frame. The advancements in camera lens today has made them imperative to cameras as they allow for them to be dynamic and multifunctional in different circumstances, however, the future of camera lens’ ponders removing the camera lens altogether.
            In 2009, the scientist at MIT to find new ways to produce images without camera lens thought of using engineered fibers that can detect light intensity and direction to create a picture. In 2016, optic engineers have made that step toward creating a lens without the use of glass, the “metalenses” that is made up of small patterned towers that function in the same way glass does in dispersing light, except they are thinner than a human hair. Although revolutionizing what was for decades
            unchanging, these advancements were only possible through the understanding of the optic law.</p>
