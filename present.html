          <p>The optic lens design primary goal is to minimize the amount of aberration while utilizing the least amount of material whether synthetic or natural, thus permitting the lens to be more flexible and efficient in light refracting. Today many lens companies strive to engineer such lenses to produce the most precise and high-quality images; 
            however many admit that it is almost impossible to develop a lens that can be versatile enough to execute high-quality pictures in every condition. For example, Takayuki Sensui from NIKKOR, the image development sector of Nikon stated in an interview “it is impossible to create a lens that is perfect for capturing every type of scene or subject, or for use under all possible conditions”. Nevertheless, designers and engineers have made many of us today benefactors of this challenge as today the majority of people possess smartphones capable of capturing high-quality 2D images. The span of types of camera lens today is immense and continues to grow from digital cameras, smartphones, printers/ scanners, projectors, eyeglasses, to the  EHDC (External High Def Camera) found on the ISS.</p>
